      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the 7X Ranch. Ranching and farming has been our way of life for the past 40 years. Previous owners of Nature's Choice Dairy in Wyoming and the Ruby Ranch in Utah. We specialize in Irish Black beef cattle and alfalfa hay. 
        In 2022 we bought the 7X Ranch and have restored it to its former glory, this time for the glory of God. Our desire is to use our property to host families, friends, church groups, and Christian retreats. 
        Each of our lodgings is equipped with hot and cold water, fully functional kitchens, laundry units, Starlink internet, and more.
        We hope you will come and experience God's beauty and peace at our ranch</p>

      <h3><strong>Our Desire</strong></h3>
      <p>Our desire is to use the 7X Ranch to bring glory to God and allow people to experience His goodness. We know that all things are by the grace of God and we hope to share our beautiful property with you.</p>
